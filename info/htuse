	So... I think You have The Pen NOW!
and!  you can write anything...
How : 

WARNING:
This game is made only for drawing geometric shapes, names or letters only,
 and I am not responsible for any other drawing contrary to what I mentioned.
 
-Your pen is actually on half of the paper 'o', and you need to move it to write something.
-to do this you need to execute the 'play' file with MegaTerm,
-but before you need to know how to 'Move The Pen', you have 4 commands with a digit,

if you need to move the pen to up one time just enter after the ./executable : ./play
if you need to move the pen to down : ./play
if ...                 ...                  to right : ./play right
...                    ...                   to left ... emmm that's really easy without stupid explaining     
[...] you can choose any digit here.
exemple : 
./play right right right ...5 times up 3 left 5 down 3, i know it's so hard but the next update i will develope to become : ./play up[5] down[...]... 
			ooooo
			o   o
			ooooo

Easy game right ?
... NO
Because you only have x parameters max in every exercise.
and... i will give you some HARD exercises to do it... you find it on challenge folder
goodLuck...
